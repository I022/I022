- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Iman, and I am in my final year studying Information Systems at the University of Cape Town.  
- ðŸ’¡ I am passionate and skilled in using technology to solve complex business challenges through critical thinking and optimizing of existing processes. My experience spans across systems analysis, software development, database management, cloud computing and project management. 
- ðŸŒ± One of my most significant accomplishments in terms of coding was contributing to a project for Impact.com last year, where my team and I developed an Online Multiplayer Trivia Game. This project involved integrating Spotify's API to provide dynamic in-game features, managing real-time databases using Firebase, and implementing multiplayer functionality through Unity Gaming Services to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience.  
- ðŸ“š At present, I am tutoring students at UCT with their final project for the same course, providing guidance and support to help them succeed.
